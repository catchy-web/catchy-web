# Decide what to eat

Are you hungry? [[**YES!**]](#go-to-the-kitchen) <> [[no]](#try-again)

## Try again

You are not hungry. Maybe you want to play a [[game]](#decide-what-to-eat)?

## Go to the kitchen

Welcome to your kitchen. There is probably food around here. Have you bought some recently? [[money was spent]](#richie-rich) <> [[i don't remember]](#what-a-week-huh)

### Richie Rich

Ok, you bought food. Look around. Have you already eaten everything or is there still something left? [[peek into the fridge]](#hello-penguins) <> [[look around]](#fruity-fruits)

#### Hello? Penguins?

Yay, there is food in the fridge! But it is also cold in here. Get some and close it. Fast! Go! [[brrrrr. lucky me]](#fed)

#### Fruity fruits

You love fruits and bought some. Good for you! [[yummy!]](#fed)

### What a week, huh?

Go get some food because you will be hungry soon! [[go back to the kitchen]](#go-to-the-kitchen)

## Fed

Hooray! You found something to eat! [[satified!]](#try-again) <> [[but still...]](#decide-what-to-eat)
