# catchy-lang - the catchy (programming) language

> Status: Idea and research step. See [this blog](../blog/maunzCache/human-centric-programming.md) for the inception.

## Wants and thoughts

- Signal words are easy to read and align better with natural language
- It starts of english based
- "Dialects" can be used to support catchy-lang to other world languages such as japanese, german, swedish, etc.
- To use it, the environment has to be as non-technical as possible e.g. be able to run it in a browser
- It is not hardware or perfomance optimized or optimizable but "application" oriented
- For inclusion, there is always feedback required: Visual, tactile, auditive, whatever is possible
- It will probably never compile itself, so it is okay to write it in an existing programming language
