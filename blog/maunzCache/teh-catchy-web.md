# Teh catchy web

*2025-06-25*

Jupp, there is a typo and i won't fix it.

So, i was watching [Death of the tadi web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft6xOAijwFo) yesterday.
I don't get any of it. So i started my own catchy web.

The idea is: Put everything into this repository as long as it is fun. Everything will be published. There is no bad ideas.

I will start with mardown until its no more fun.
