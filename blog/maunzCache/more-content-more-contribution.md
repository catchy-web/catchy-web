Hi all,

after a cold start this week, i have to figure out what is going on here.

I wasn't quite sure if the markdown that is being sent to Github Pages allows to use JavaScript,
but hell it does! So i copied an idea which i liked (see [1000 checkboxes](../../games/1000-checkboxes.md))
and emulated random people ticking and unticking boxes.
To me, it feels like it was a real thing with a database in the background capturing inputs of millions.
Its fake at the same time it is real.

When writing the code i went for the most simple solution because we are **slippy** around here,
but [@luminousherbs](https://github.com/luminousherbs) decided it had to be something different.
And that is fine.

**Let code die**

No one knows what will happen next.
