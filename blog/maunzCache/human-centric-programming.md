# Human centric programming

*2025-06-29*

I was thinking what to do next.
My brain has a lot of ideas I usually cannot pull of, but i want to try a new approach with the `catchy-web`.
For me, programming picked up around 20 years ago.
Probably a bit earlier still.
For most kids at that time the web was the go to place.
That means start with HTML.

HTML is beautiful, because it is a "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) kind of language.
From my point of view it was easy to pick up, because of its simplicity.
Often things had names that you'd expect, but not always.
If you wanted to do like ***real*** programming, PHP was your next step.

And now here we are after so much time.
I peeked into at least 20 different languages and syntaxes.
None of those were mastered by me.

When I think about it, only one was close to be comprehensible by humans: [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)). It has the same visual feedback and thus very satisfying.

So i was thinking, why not come up with a programming language that would be more human centric.
Obviously, i am not the first one to think about it, but maybe i want to think about it.
